                <p style="color:navy">The University of Paris is a wonderful option for Computer Science majors
                    and other majors alike. One unique thing about the University of Paris is that is has multiple
                    campuses. This means that you have a wider range of schools to choose from. So come to the city of love,
                    learn some Computer Science (maybe some French), and eat some amazing food.
