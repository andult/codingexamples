                <p style="color:navy">Many people shy away from the idea of studying abroad. There's a lot of fear in moving to a new country where perhaps you don't know the language or any of the people there. However, studying abroad, especially as a CS major, is an invaluable experience. There are endless places you can study in and different types of programs, so there is definitely a good fit for everyone.
